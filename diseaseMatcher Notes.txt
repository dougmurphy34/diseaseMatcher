Objective: Develop a citizen science game, based on ESP/Google Image Labeler model, to identify disease names in the text of biomedical research abstracts.

Features: User login/profiles, player vs. AI if no active opponent, time pressure, document storage and display, results storage.

Models: Artigo.org - successor to ESP
        Cyclonecenter.org and others at zooniverse.org

Tools used:     django 1.6.5 web framework (lab standard, personal preference for python over java)
		        MariaDB 10 (more feature rich than mySQL, easier administration than PostgreSQL)
		        Python 2.7
	            VirtualEnvWrapper (Windows port):
		           https://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenvwrapper-win
	            Pycharm Enterprise
	            HeidiSQL
	            MySQL-python 1.2.5
	                binary from http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/
	            GitHub - source control (dougmurphy34/diseaseMatcher)
	            NO data migration - just syncdb
	                (confirmed, South does not and will not support MariaDB http://south.aeracode.org/ticket/1309)

Design Principles used:
    test-driven development
    MVC model as implemented by django
    Loose coupling
    Agile Development (Frequent functional builds)


Status of development (8/20/2014):
    Landing page receives user, navigates to single (random) abstract display with input form

Next steps:
    Baseline UI functionality on abstract display (for user input)
    Take text input from user and store it in database
