Objective: Develop a citizen science game, based on ESP/Google Image Labeler model, to identify disease names in the text of biomedical research abstracts.

Features: User login/profiles, player vs. AI, time pressure, document storage and display, results storage.

Models: Artigo.org - successor to ESP
        Cyclonecenter.org and others at zooniverse.org

Tools used:     django 1.6.5 web framework (lab standard, personal preference for python over java)
		        MariaDB 10 (more feature rich than mySQL, easier administration than PostgreSQL)
		        Python 2.7
		        jQuery 1.11.1
	            VirtualEnvWrapper (Windows port):
		           https://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenvwrapper-win
	            Pycharm Enterprise
	            HeidiSQL
	            MySQL-python 1.2.5
	                binary from http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/
	            GitHub - source control (dougmurphy34/diseaseMatcher)
	            NO data migration - just syncdb
	                (confirmed, South does not and will not support MariaDB http://south.aeracode.org/ticket/1309)

Design Principles used:
    Unit testing (but not true test-driven development)
    MVC model as implemented by django
    Loose coupling
    Agile Development (Frequent functional builds)


Status of development (8/20/2014):
    Landing page receives user, navigates to single (random) abstract display with input form
    User can enter text (disease matches) for that abstract, and results are stored in the database on submission.

Next steps:
    Post-submission navigation.
    Error checking and tests for database submissions.
