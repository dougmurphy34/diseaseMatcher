Disease Matcher Game Designs

1) SpeedMatcher
GAMEPLAY:
User tries to classify abstract to single disease.  Once they have picked the same answer as their partner, they move
    on to the next abstract.  Points scored based on number of abstracts classified in 60 seconds.

AI WIZARDRY:
All(?) GS answers are preloaded from DB.  50% of the time the AI is "faster" than the user - as soon as the user picks one
    of those answers, they get a match and move on.  Other 50% the AI is "slower" - capability of matching kicks in
    at a random time 4-7 seconds from load of abstract.

BENEFITS TO THIS MODEL:
--Time pressure feels intense, engaging player.
--Clear scoring system in current game and over time (how many abstracts did you get?).
--High volume of data gathered per user-minute.

WEAKNESSES OF THIS MODEL:
--Nothing on the screen moves.  This is bad for user engagement.
--Low replayability.  Gets boring quickly.  Best way to sell it: Focus on leaderboard and some easy-to-visualize
    contribution to science.
--Speed model encourages false positives (identifying any big sciency word).


2) DeepMatcher
GAMEPLAY:
User tries to pick the same disease-phrases as partner.  User tries to get to three matches in the quickest possible
    time.  Game ends on third match or 60 seconds elapsed.  Score based on speed to third match.

AI WIZARDRY:
Gold Standard answers pulled from database.  At a random time every 3-5 seconds one of the GS answers is chosen at random
    and "activated".  Match is recorded as soon as a phrase is user-entered and AI-activated.

BENEFITS TO THIS MODEL:
--Feels more interactive.  The Fiero moments in the game requires you and your "partner" to work together, and some of
    your answers will turn green without your input.
--If an abstract is related to several diseases, we are much more likely to get them all.

WEAKNESSES OF THIS MODEL:
--Hard to measure long-term progress in a way that encourages the user to keep playing.
--In abstracts that have only one clear answer, we will get some "junk" answers in nearly the same frequency as the
    correct answer.
